# Project-CSCI-114-
Description: in this project, you will implement a bounded buffer queue (BBQ) based on Fig. 5.8 in the textbook, where lock variable is used to synchronize the access of queues. 20 threads are created with 10 producers and 10 consumers. The size of the queue MAX should be a constant and can be changed (at of time of testing). Your program should display the following events on screen:  Thread creation Item ID # produced by thread number # Item ID # consumed by thread number # Waiting to produce by thread number # Waiting to consume by thread number # Your program should run with a command "project1 TP TC, where project1 is the executable program, TP represents the "initial" sleep time range limit for producing threads and TC represents the sleep time range limit for consuming threads.
